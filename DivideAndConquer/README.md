Divide and Conquer is a clever way to solve big problems by breaking them down into smaller, easier ones.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array or list by repeatedly dividing it into smaller sub-arrays or sub-lists until each small part consists of a single element or is empty. These small parts are then merged back together in a manner that results in a sorted array. The key process is the merging of two sorted sequences, which is done by comparing their elements one by one and placing them into a new array in the correct order. This method is efficient and ensures stable sorting, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
